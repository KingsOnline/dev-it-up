# dev-it-up
A chrome extension that switches from to the dev version of the King's Online Design System CSS on any KEATS page.

## About

The King's Online Design System is constantly being refined with new features and enhancements lined up for the next release. A Chrome extension has been developed in order to help users visualise how a live page will look upon the next release by displaying the page with the development stylesheets.

## Installation

The extension is a small software program which can only be used on Chrome. Ensure that you have the browser available and continue with the following steps.

### Step 1. Download the Chrome extension

Clicking the **Code** button activates a dropdown menu. Select **Download ZIP** to save the files locally.

### Step 2. Unzip the folder

Navigate to the zipped folder using the File explorer and select **Extract all...** to unzip the files to a chosen location on your device.

### Step 3. Install the Chrome extension

1. Return to the browser and open the [settings page](chrome://settings/) (or copy chrome://settings/ to the address bar), selecting **Extensions**
2. Toggle on **Developer mode** in the top right of the toolbar
3. Select the **Load unpacked** button from the button group
4. Locate the folder saved in Step 2 and **Select folder** and dev-it-up extension will now appear in its own card within the extensions panel.
5. To the right of the address bar, selecting the Extentions puzzle piece icon will allow you to pin the dev-it-up extension

### Step 4. Test it out!

Upon successful installation of the extension, the dev-it-up icon will appear to the right of the address bar. Click the icon to toggle the extension on and off.

The icon will display as grey when inactive and red when the extension is running.

The extension has access to all KEATS pages. If the page you wish to view was already loaded prior to the installation of the extension, you may need to perform a hard refresh before activating the extension. In Windows, the shortcut for this is Control + F5 and on a Mac, the shortcut is Command + Shift + R. If the extension is already active when opening a KEATS page, you may need to toggle the extension off and on again to see the effects.
